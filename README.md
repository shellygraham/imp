Theme files for Foundation 6 client site. Please note I opted to build this site semantically through the use of <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/grid.html">Zurb's Sass mixins</a>. I strongly prefer this method and use either Foundation 6 or <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/">Bourbon Neat</a> framework depending on the site.
